all-numbers
===========

  This is my first java project I did alone (My first one was with The Multi-launcher 3751_Creator: https://github.com/AlexandreSP/Multi-Launcher). 
        It's a software that has two buttons: 
    the first one is to substract 1 to the number
    the second one is to add 1 to the number
      the number at the beginning is 0.
          Thank you for reading.
